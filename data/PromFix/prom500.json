        "Predict whether a sequence contains a TSS (Transcription Start Site). Length of a sequence is 500 bp. Each promoter generates a positive example. Positive examples are random sequences that includes [TSS-250, TSS+50). Negative examples are randomly selected from the human genome, with no overlapping with any positive examples. TSS information is downloaded from EPDnew (tss_edpnew.bed).",
