        "Predict whether a sequence contains a TSS (Transcription Start Site). Length of a sequence is 300 bp. Positive examples span from TSS-250 (inclusive) to TSS+50 (exclusive). Negative examples are randomly selected from the human genome, with no overlapping with any positive examples. TSS information is downloaded from EPDnew (tss_edpnew.bed).",
